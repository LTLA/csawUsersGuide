Description: A user's guide for the csaw package for detecting 
    differentially bound regions in ChIP-seq data. Describes how to
    read in BAM files to obtain a per-window count matrix, filtering 
    to obtain high-abundance windows of interest, normalization 
    of sample-specific biases, testing for differential binding, 
    consolidation of per-window results to obtain per-region statistics,
    and annotation and visualization of the DB results.
